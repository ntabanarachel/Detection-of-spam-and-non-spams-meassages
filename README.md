# Detection-of-spam-and-non-spams-messages
Machine Learning / Supervised Learning
We specifically have “spambase.data” that contains the actual data, and (ii) files “spambase.names” and “spambase.DOCUMENTATION” contain the description of the data. This dataset has 4601 records, each record representing a different email message. Each record is described with 58 attributes (indicated in the aforementioned .names file): attributes 1-57 represent various content-based characteristics extracted from each email message (related to the frequency of certain words or certain punctuation symbols in a message as well as to the usage of capital letters in a message), and the last attribute represents the class label for each message (spam or non-spam).
# task
 The general task for this problem is to build two separate models for detecting spam messages (based on the email characteristics that are given) using RapidMiner or any other tool you prefer (e.g., Python, Spark, etc.):
1. I used the two algorithms which are K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree algorithm to find The best possible model that I can build in terms of the overall
predictive accuracy;
